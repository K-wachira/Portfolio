                    Right now I am learning more about product management. I
                    have been an engineer for almost 2 years and its great to
                    build products, but I want to learn how to think
                    strategically about what we build.

                    The coolest project I ever built was creating a browser
                    extension that enables clients to provide micro-feedback on
                    various interactions they have with a specific vendors in
                    online meetings. It's my proudest because I was involved in
                    the entire product pipeline, from how users interact with
                    extensions to how data is inserted, updated, and enriched on
                    the backend. It's also my favorite because I got to
                    experiment with various technologies using platforms like
                    Foundry with user data to understand relationships between
                    clients and vendors quickly.

                    My skill set covers a variety of areas related to
                    backend-development, automations, data analysis, and machine
                    learning.

                  Outside of work, I love bike ridding, rollerskating and
                  occasional hiking photography
